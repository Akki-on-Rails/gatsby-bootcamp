      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>My name ist Frank Gerngro√ü and I am a Frontend Developer. I used to work as a Graphic Designer for almost 15 years.
        Two years ago I discovered coding as a hobby. Some time later I decided to switch from the old job to a new one as a Web Developer.
        I joined a bootcamp and started developing web pages and web applications.</p>
      <p>My profound knowledge and experience as a Graphic Designer is a real advantage making communication with UX/UI and clients much easier.</p>
